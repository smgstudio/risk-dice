**Edit: we have big changes to this code going live in v3.20 around August this year - read more about what's coming [here](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128810/view/640181878351987970).**

This is the dice code used in the [RISK: Global Domination](https://www.hasbrorisk.com/invite) game written in C# for Unity as of version 3.3.

- Calculates all outcome probabilities for a given Risk battle using brute-force
- Includes the Balanced Blitz dice mode algorithm
- Supports dice augments seen in the game such as Capitals & Zombies
- Supports blitz attack limit (Stop Until)
- Includes six different RNG implementations

# Examples

1. Find the chance of losing 2 troops as the attacker in a standard 3 vs 2 dice round
```csharp
var roundInfo = RoundCache.Get(RoundConfig.Default);
roundInfo.Calculate();

print(roundInfo.AttackLossChances[2]);
// 0.292566872427984
```
2. Find the win chance for attacking 800 zombies with 300 troops
```csharp
var roundConfig = RoundConfig.Default;
roundConfig.ApplyAugments(DiceAugment.None, DiceAugment.IsZombie);
    
var winChanceInfo = WinChanceCache.Get(1000, roundConfig, null);
winChanceInfo.Calculate();
    
print(winChanceInfo.WinChances[300, 800]);
// 0.8897331
```
3. Compare true random and balanced blitz, with the chance of losing 12 out of 30 troops when attacking a capitol territory with 15 troops
```csharp
RoundConfig roundConfig = RoundConfig.Default;
roundConfig.ApplyAugments(DiceAugment.None, DiceAugment.OnCapital);

var battleConfig = new BattleConfig(30, 15, 0);

var battle = BattleCache.Get(roundConfig, battleConfig);
battle.Calculate();

var balancedBattle = new BalancedBattleInfo(battle, BalanceConfig.Default);
balancedBattle.ApplyBalance();

print($"TR: {battle.AttackLossChances[12]} | BB: {balancedBattle.AttackLossChances[12]}");
// TR: 0.0222128001707278 | BB: 0.0100282888709122
```
4. Simulate and print the results of 3 standard 10 vs 10 true random battles using a non-default (MersenneTwister) RNG implementation
```csharp
var battleConfig = new BattleConfig(10, 10, 0);
var rngConfig = new RNGConfig(RNGType.MersenneTwister, SeedMode.Auto);

var simulator = new BattleSimulator(battleConfig, RoundConfig.Default, null, rngConfig);

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    simulator.Blitz(BattleSimulator.BlitzMethod.OddsBasedBattle);
    print($"Battle: {i + 1} | Result: {simulator.GetStatus()} | Remaining: {simulator.RemainingAttackCount} / {simulator.RemainingDefendCount}");
    simulator.Reset();
}

// Battle: 1 | Result: DefenderWin | Remaining: 0 / 4
// Battle: 2 | Result: AttackerWin | Remaining: 4 / 0
// Battle: 3 | Result: AttackerWin | Remaining: 3 / 0
```
5. Simulate 1,000,000 dice rolls using the default RNG (PCG)
```csharp
var rng = RNGConfig.Default.GetRNG();

for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    print(rng.NextInt(0, 5));

// 3, 2, 4, 1, 0, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4...
```
6. Calculate the minimum attack troops required to have at least an 80% win chance against 50 defending troops in balanced blitz
```csharp
int idealUnits = SimulationHelper.CalculateIdealUnits(50, 0.8f, RoundConfig.Default, BalanceConfig.Default);

print(idealUnits);
// 49
```
# Additional Info

### One Troop Left Behind

All calculations do **not** include the single attack troop that stays behind when attacking. For example, consider a territory with 20 troops attacking another with 10 troops. The *BattleConfig* setup of that will look like:
```csharp
new BattleConfig(19, 10, 0);
```

### Clearing Caches

When testing performance, it is important to consider clearing the memory cache as that will have a significant impact on results.
```csharp
RoundCache.Clear();
BattleCache.Clear();
WinChanceCache.Clear();
```

### Blitz Methods

There are three methods to choose from when simulating a battle. *Note: Balanced Blitz only supports **OddsBasedBattle***
|Method|RNG Usage|How it works|
|--|--|--|
|DiceRoll|int per dice roll|Simulates each individual dice roll from random ints|
|OddsBasedRound|float per round|Simulates each round result from a single random float|
|OddsBasedBattle|float per battle|Simulates the entire battle from a single random float|

### Limitations

The Balanced Blitz dice mode works by adjusting the true probabilities of every possible outcome in a given Risk battle. Outcome probability does not mean the chance of winning the battle as a whole, but instead considers how many troops are left behind. For example: "attacker winning with 5 troops remaining" or "defender winning with 64 troops remaining".

A brute-force approach is employed to calculate these true outcome probabilities for the Balanced Blitz algorithm to base from. Because of this, large battles get very expensive in terms of CPU usage and memory allocation, especially if a dice augment like Capitals is involved. In an effort to prevent stutters/crashes in older/lower-end devices from these large calculations, an estimation technique is used to determine a result much more quickly.

It works by extrapolating the data from smaller battles of similar attacker vs defender ratio using polynomial regression. The accuracy is not perfect and can result in discrepancies between the game and this code. The estimation source code is **not** provided in this repository, because ideally the brute-force method can be replaced in the future with a much quicker alternative.
